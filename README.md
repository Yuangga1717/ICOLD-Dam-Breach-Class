# ICOLD-Dam-Breach-Hazard-Class
A flood classification map was created, with the classification system drawn from the works of ICOLD. The resulting map is divided into three classes. The dam collapse was employed as a case study, with the resultant flood characterised by its speed and depth. This led to delineation of three boundaries: low hazard, medium hazard, and high hazard.

The following relationship between flood speed and depth is indicated in the 2018 ICOLD report, which is also included in the appendix of the Indonesian emergency action plan analysis guidelines.

The range is delineated by two lines: the lower and upper limits. The area below the lower limit is designated as the low danger zone, the area above the upper limit is designated as the high danger zone, and the area in between is designated as the medium danger zone.
The boundary line is to be transformed into two lines in the X and Y axes, as follows:
flood depth	flood velocity

 0.05 	2.00	3.60
