# ICOLD-Dam-Breach-Hazard-Class
A flood classification map was created, with the classification system drawn from the works of ICOLD. The resulting map is divided into three classes. The dam collapse was employed as a case study, with the resultant flood characterised by its speed and depth. This led to delineation of three boundaries: low hazard, medium hazard, and high hazard.
